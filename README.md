## Using ForecastFramework to forecast flu in Germany

This repository holds some code and models for forecasting influenza in Germany. We used the [ForecastFramework](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ForecastFramework) package. The models were contributed by students and the instructor for the UMass Biostatistics PhD seminar in spring 2019.

More documentation of data and models coming soon. Preliminary results can be found [here](https://github.com/reichlab/german-flu-forecasting/blob/master/doc/testing_results.pdf).
